// RakNet funnels every outgoing datagram through a single socket send, which is
// below the packet layer, so that is the only place the server's RTT estimate can
// actually be influenced. Delaying packet objects higher up (PacketSender) does
// not move it at all.
//
// Only plain data datagrams are held. ACK/NAK datagrams are always passed
// straight through, which is the one thing a generic traffic shaper cannot do:
// clumsy delays ACKs too, so past ~200ms the server's reliable-send window
// stalls, the world freezes, and the link eventually times out. Letting ACKs run
// at full speed keeps the connection healthy while our data still arrives late.

    // the socket is the one carrying it.
